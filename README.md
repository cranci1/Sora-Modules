# Sora-Modules

This repository contains the following modules: **_JellyFin_** and **_Emby_**, which allows you to enjoy emby and jellyfin on [Sora](https://github.com/cranci1/Sora).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Configure Your Server Info**  
   Open the JS file and replace the placeholders with:
   - Your Emby/JellyFin server's base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8096`)
   
   - Your Emby/JellyFin user ID. You can find it in Dashboard -> Users -> Select the user -> take the "userID" value from the URL (e.g., "http://localhost:8096/web/#/dashboard/users/profile?userId=529c1be6ba1048ccbdbde06b94bff4e2", userID will be: "529c1be6ba1048ccbdbde06b94bff4e2")
   
   - Your Emby/JellyFin API Key. You can create an API Key in Dashboard -> Api Keys -> generate a new one and copy the token.

2. **Host the Files Privately**  
   Upload both the `.js` and `.json` files to a **private** server.  
   ⚠️ Do **not** host these files publicly — exposing your JellyFin/Emby host can compromise your server.

3. **Update the JSON File**  
   In the JSON file, set the `scriptUrl` key to the **raw URL** of your hosted JS file.

4. **Import to Sora**  
   Copy the **raw URL** of your JSON file and import it into Sora.
